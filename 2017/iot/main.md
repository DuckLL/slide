# Introduction

- Iot data collction would double every 18 months
- 20 billion to 35 billion connect devices in 2020
- Use cloud -> outside the typical firewall
- Fog computing
- Resource-constrained -> can't use traditional security tools(like AV)

---

# Deploy of IoT

- QoS in Iot -> ability to prioritise data streams from different devices
- No agreed standards currently -> difficult indded security promblems.
- Local device need special care to prevent crash
- compact and reduce data on-site
- Server use NoSQL
- Medical and power grid need verifiable computing
- Smart Hourse -> Industry 4.0
- EUâ€™s General Data Protection Act (GDPA) -> protect personal data breaches
- Need ways of updating the millions of deployed devices

## The Unikernel Angle

Unikernels are specialised, single address space machine images constructed by using library operating systems <!-- .element: align="left" -->

![](./unikernel.png)

--

# Client

- Unified interface to diverse hardware
- Parallel-alized development
- Same environment
- IncludeOS
- Atomic update  
  (ChromeOS switch boot partitions to update and backup)

--

# Virtualisation

- Higher capacity
- Sustainability

--

# Server

- Non-mutable state
- Event-based
- Dynamic scale-out
- Local pre-process(using NAS)

---

### Challenges, Problems, Limitations

1. Unikernels are Only a Part of the Solution
1. Production-Level Debugging
1. Impact upon Software Development
1. Virtualisation in the Embedded Space

## Unikernels are Only

## a Part of the Solution

Infrastructure for handling

1. roll-out
1. monitoring
1. logging.

has yet to be written.

--

## Production-Level Debugging

- Unikernels lack debugging facilities(no shell)
- Securely connecting the debugging tools to the running unikernel

--

### Impact upon Software Development

- Signle execution thread or process
- Prevents adoption of existing software packages
- Initially limiting resilience resaech to server-side unikernels

--

## Virtualisation in the Embedded Space

- Different architectures, hardware
- No enough resource virtualisation
- KVM/ARM paravirtualization for unlikely
- MIPS also support virtualization

---

# Conclusions

- Iot security or disaster
- No security no privacy
- Experienced and talented developer resources are scarce at hand
- Virtualisation -> reuse existing knowledge and tool
- Cloud unikernels -> Restful
- Homomorphic encryption, verifiable computing
